# My dotfiles

Streamlining auto-configuration on new machines since 2021!

## Installation

This repo is intended to be cloned into/as the system's `~/.config` directory.

Here is an inefficient example of such:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/massivebird/dotfiles
mv dotfiles/* ~/.config
rm -rf dotfiles
```

I'll make a better way later I promise
