# My dotfiles

Streamlining auto-configuration on new machines since 2021!

## Installation

This repo is intended to be cloned into/as the system's `~/.config` directory.

### Lazy way

This works on fresh Ubuntu Server installation _after deleting the existing `~/.config` directory._

`git clone https://github.com/massivebird/dotfiles ~/.config`

I'll make a better way later I promise
